       <p align="left">During the COVID period in 2020, the HHC created a lockdown series wherein there was a new post was put up that talked about something relevant to the pandemic.<br> <br>
Episode 1<br>  it started off with “Lockdown Ideas for Quaranteens” a video wherein the teenager members of our club showed the viewers some basic activities they could carry out in the lockdown to cure their boredom whether that be coffee painting, reading, knitting amongst others.<br><br>
Episode 2<br> we collaborated with IHF Wellness Coach and consultant Ms. Kamna Dsouza to demonstrate to our viewers easy workouts to keep ourselves fit in the challenging period. This was especially helpful since it did not require any equipment and could be done in the space of our own homes.<br><br>
Episode 3<br> We then collaborated with Ms. Sheetal Shah a personal counsellor who spoke about the “Importance of a Digital Detox” in a time wherein devices and technology were constantly in use to stay connected yet the importance of taking time off it and spending it with family.<br><br>
Episode 4<br> We then initiated a Plank Challenge wherein a few of our members demonstrated the plank and showed true commitment towards keeping themselves fit and healthy during the pandemic. One of our members also showed the Surya Namaskar.<br><br>
Episode 5<br> We started the “Corona Empathy Challenge” among the young members of the club who started showing empathy in small ways at home by helping wash the dishes, ironing clothes, making small treats or vacuuming the house.<br><br>
Episode 6<br> Our final episode “Women who are Entrepreneurs”  entailed an interview with Ms. Afia who is the first bookish candle maker in India. She talked about how to manage the business along with her schooling and shared some useful insights. <br>
