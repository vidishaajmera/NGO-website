        <p align="left">Collaborating with Shespires, this two day event was in partnership with Angel Xpress NGO. <br>
On Day 1, students of grades 9, and 10 were introduced to subjects like economics, business, and psychology. The purpose of this workshop was to discuss the basics of each subject so that students are a little familiar with them before they decide the stream they would like to pursue.<br>Small activities blended with real-world examples were discussed in a 2â€“3-hour interactive session.<br> To end the day, a small positivity activity was conducted. 
<br>The second day started off with a long discussion on various and their contents, such as I Am Malala. Thereafter, we conducted a short build-a-story activity where each person said a sentence to make up a random story, turn by turn. <br>The children ended up using ideas from the books that were discussed earlier, ending up with their own unique story.<br> Our team had pre-prepared a short dance routine which was taught to the children.
