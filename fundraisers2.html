            <img src="book_sale.png"  height="200" width="250" alt="Book Sale Fundraiser" class="fundraiser-img-right">
            <p align="left">Our book sale fundraisers have been a key part of our fundraising efforts, raising significant funds to support girls' education. By selling donated books, we've garnered strong community participation, ensuring each event is a resounding success. The funds raised have provided essential educational resources and scholarships, empowering young girls. These events highlight the power of community involvement and the joy of reading, demonstrating the impact of collective action for a noble cause.

            <h3>Jogathons – Jog for a Cause</h3>
            <img src="img9.jpg" height="200" width="250" alt="Jogathon" class="fundraiser-img-left">
            <p align="left">The Helping Hands Club (HHC) recently collaborated with the Interact Club of Mumbai Jewels to organize a Jogathon fundraiser. In this event, 50 children from the NGO and 25 club members jogged for a distance of 5 kilometers. The fundraiser was a great success, with all the proceeds being donated to the Saaksharta NGO. The HHC members played a crucial role by using the funds to purchase food and tiffin boxes, which they then personally distributed to underprivileged children. This initiative not only promoted fitness and community spirit but also directly benefited those in need, highlighting the commitment of both clubs to social welfare and support for education through their charitable activities.

            <p align="left">The HHC collaborated with the Interact Club of Mumbai Jewels to organize a Bikathon fundraiser wherein the 15 members bicycled for 10km. All proceeds were donated to the Rotary Club of Mumbai Jewels’ project to help 350 underprivileged children who had lost their parent(s) in COVID. Education was hit particularly hard by the Covid - 19 pandemic with 1.53 Billion learners out of school and 184 school closures, impacting about 87% of the world’s total enrolled learners. “Education Cannot Wait” was the tagline of this event.</p>
