                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Back in 2018, a modest initiative called “Little Helping Hands” was started by two sisters, Anoushka Shah and Anagha Shah, after being inspired by the book “I am Malala”. We realized that girl child education is an issue that cannot be overlooked, even in our own country. Recognizing the urgency of this matter, we decided to take proactive measures to address this crucial challenge facing our nation, especially with its vast young population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We commenced by organizing book sale fundraisers, channeling the proceeds towards the education of girls. The overwhelming success of each event drew attention from like-minded teenagers, expanding our initiative. Consequently, Little Helping Hands evolved into The Helping Hands Club, attracting numerous young individuals eager to contribute to society. What began with just two members has now grown to over 50, marking a truly remarkable journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a club, we have witnessed significant growth and enthusiastic participation from our members in every event. We take immense pride in our collaborations with various NGOs and other clubs over the years, successfully raising substantial funds. These funds have been consistently donated to causes that our Club passionately supports. Our efforts range from sponsoring the education fees for five girls for an entire year to distributing cloth bags in our locality free of charge, as well as organizing large-scale Jogathons and book sale fundraisers. We are committed to supporting both social and environmental causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ethos of our Club is to contribute to society in an engaging, Gen Z manner. Our tagline remains – “Helping Hands, Caring Hearts.” We are thrilled to continue hosting impactful events within our community as we progress on this journey.
